Project 1: Ocean Swerve

OceanBed Swerve is an instrument designed to give the performer liberty of controlling the ocean acoustic background by not only modulating deep water sounds (influenced by natural processes sounds, marine life sounds etc.) but also creating and modulating the bubble sounds of the shallow waters.

Mozzi library with an Arduino is used to achieve these modulations.
